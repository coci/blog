I’m Sallar Kaboli, a 27 years old senior software engineer living in *Helsinki, Finland*. I was born and raised in [Tehran, Iran](https://500px.com/search?q=Tehran&submit=Submit&type=photos) and moved to Finland early 2015. I’m currently working at [Tieto](https://www.tieto.com/) where I do all things JavaScript. I was previously at [Kiosked](http://kiosked.com).

I started programming in 2003 using QBasic and then moved on to PHP and started a career coding PHP web applications. I then got interested in Web Design and that helped shape my future in web development. After Node.JS was born and JavaScript started getting stronger, I decided to focus mostly on JavaScript and that’s where I’m at today. Recently I’ve been interested in exploring Swift, C and IoT as a hobby.

I love spending time with my beautiful wife, [Sharareh](https://twitter.com/Sharareh_) whom without love and care I wouldn’t be able to do what I do best.
